# Phone Specs Hub
Is a project made using the [Phone Specs Api](https://github.com/azharimm/phone-specs-api) and [PhoneWise Api](https://phonewise.onrender.com/api/search?q=apple) for the search function due to malfunctions with the original Phone Specs Api.

I developed this project with the primary goal of continuous learning and skill improvement, adding new technologies to be familiar with such as MUI and Axios HTTP.
This project features a fully responsive design with re-utilized modular components which is the case for the cards, search done locally in the case for the brands, utilization of skeletons as a way to give feedback to the user that a page is loading. 
The [Phone Specs Hub](https://phonespecshub.netlify.app/) is hosted on Netlify.
