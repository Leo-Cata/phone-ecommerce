# Phone Specs Hub

This is a project created using the [Phone Specs Api](https://github.com/azharimm/phone-specs-api) and [PhoneWise Api](https://phonewise.onrender.com/api/search?q=apple) for the search function, due to malfunctions with the original Phone Specs API.

I developed this project with the primary goal of continuous learning and skill improvement, incorporating new technologies such as MUI (Material-UI) and Axios for HTTP requests.

The project features a fully responsive design with modular components that are reused throughout, including the cards. Local search functionality is implemented for brands, and skeleton loading screens provide feedback to the user during page loading.

The [Phone Specs Hub](https://phonespecshub.netlify.app/)  is hosted on Netlify.
